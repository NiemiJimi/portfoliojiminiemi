        Golden Drift is a first-person shooter that combines high-speed vehicle combat with 
        competitive multiplayer gameplay. The objective is to control the 
        golden car. While driving the golden car you score points for your team. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Teams consists of six players. Players are given various vehicles, 
        weapons and gadgets to either defend or attack the golden car depending which team controls it. 
        Players are equal but they can be made into serving different roles. 
        For example some players can mainly be the drivers while others can be navigators guiding the driver to the right location and provide cover fire during chases. 
        With weapons and gadgets players are also given passive perks to enhance their playstyle. Higher repairing speed, explosive resistance or even movement accuracy can be a game changer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Teams spawnpoints are garages located in borders of the map. 
        In garage players can change their vehicles, weapons and gadgets. 
        In addition multiple garages work as strategic tool so players can spawn closer to the action zone depending where the golden car is currently located in the map.
      </p>
      <p>
        A team wins by gaining 1 000 000 points or they have the most points in the end of the round. 
        The golden car spawns randomly to one of three possible spawn areas and it is visible to everyone on the map and by its glowing light beam. 
        If golden car is destroyed, it spawns back to one of its spawn points. 
        During the game some parts of the map become golden so when driving there with the golden car, they are granted double points. 
        These areas become wanted controls points for both teams.
      </p>
      <p>
          Currently I have been independetly working on golden drift with a strong vision and passion to make it real one day. 
          Its in development and so far I have been working on basic elements for a FPS shooter. 
          One of the largest game systems I have used is object pooling for spawning and managing objects. It has provided a flexible and efficent structure. 
          My next goal is to implement multiplayer mechanics using Amazon Web Service. 
          I have considered switching developing this project from Unity Engine to Unreal Engine 5. 
          I believe Unreal Engine 5 provides a better platform for PC multiplayer games.
      </p>
      <p>
          I have been working on this project for almost 2 years. 
          This project has been most important factor for learning new game systems, tools and design patterns. 
          My goal is to get experience and learn as much as possible while creating this project piece by piece.
          In the future I would like to have others working in collaboration to have new perspectives and ideas to develop this further.

        The unseen aftermath of a fishing trip gone wrong between three friends. 
        A humorous yet intense VR survival game where players escape 
        down a procedurally generated river using voice control to guide their boat through dangerous obstacles. 
        Along the way, players collect helpful items using a fishing rod while trying to survive an adrenaline-filled pursuit.
      </p>
      <p>
        A team project with an objective to use advanced technologies 
        such as VR, voice recognition and procedural generation to make as immersive experience as possible. 
        These combined with a legendary fishermen trio from finnish Youtube scene is a match made in heaven.
        Voice recognition gives a unique and hilarious way to contorl the boats direction while 
        procedurally generated river makes every playthrough fresh and exciting. 
        Lastly the whole gaming experience in VR makes the player engaged with the objective and the world around them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team of three split the workload with each of us tackling on one of the advanced tehcnologies. 
        I had near none experience about procedural generation and it had intrigued me how it works while coming acroos with it in various games.
        It was a no-brainer about selecting it. 
        I combined procedural generation and data-oriented technology stack. It included calculating the mesh, burst, job system and allocating the memory manually which was also new to me. 
      </p>
        <p>
        I got it all working for our demo day which we annually have on our campus. 
        I was excited to hear feedback and development recommendations from others who had tested our project. 
        Even though it works, its not near perfect, more testing and polishing it would make it a commercial product.

        A group project created during a course, set in a 
        Mad Max-inspired post-apocalyptic wasteland. 
        The goal is to survive as long as possible and achieve the highest score.
        Crazy John Maxxer's vehicle is equipped with a plow and an 
        automatic weapon to defend against relentless enemy attacks.
      </p>
        <p>
          Our team consisted of two artists and two programmers including me. 
          I was more oriented to designing the game, leading and project management. 
          During our course our tasks revolved around different contracts and documents about our product. I mainly wrote all of them like GDD and EULA. 
          I did some programming regarding obstacles, SFX and some parts of environment. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We showed it to others during our demo day and it received a lot of great feedback and recommendations. 
            We were satisfied with it and decided ttogether to not develop it further.

        Character modeling inspired by a Roman soldier, 
        an Unreal Engine 5 top-down endless zombie shooter and
        a 2D platformer with a revolution theme all done during my first semester in game programming. 
      </p>
      <p>
        During 3D modeling and animation course our task was modeling a 3D character using 3Ds max. Task also included UV mapping, rigging, and animation. 
        This was interesting introduction to 3D modeling for me because I did not have any previous experience.
        I created a roman soldier that I animated with a animation from Mixamo for the final version. 
        I have not practiced modeling since. I have done some animation during my courses. My main focus has been on programming and project management.
      </p>
       <p>
          My first touch with Unreal Engine 5 was during our game programming course. 
          Our objective was to create a zombie shooter game with ready to use assets. 
          This task inclued player movement, shooting, score, health system and AI enemy waves. 
          Unreal Engine 5 was more complicated to use compared to Unity but it seemed as a better platform for larger projects. 
      </p>

      <p>
        During my first year we had our first game jam. We formed a team of five and we given a theme about revolution. 
        We started brainstorming and we came up with a 2D platformer with a french revolution called SO NO HEAD. 
        Our project didn't quite finish on time but as a first team project I was satisfied. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My task was making player movement. Previous experience and coding skills were primal but I came up with a some what working player character.
        Outcome was not the best but it was a great learning experience nonethless. 
        This was also my first time using version control and at first it was really confusing because we had several merging and conflict errors.
        In other words that encouraged me to learn more about it in the future.
